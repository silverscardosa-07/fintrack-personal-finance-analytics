A data-driven personal finance analytics web application that transforms raw monthly income and expense inputs into meaningful financial insights through real-time computation and interactive visualizations.

📂 **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/silverscardosa-07/fintrack-personal-finance-analytics.git


## 📊 Project Overview

FinTrack focuses on **analyzing financial data** rather than just tracking it.

The system processes user-provided income and categorized expenses to:

- calculate key financial metrics
- detect spending patterns
- generate insight-driven summaries
- visualize category-wise distributions

This simulates a **real-world analytics workflow**:
data input → processing → analysis → visualization → insights.


## 🚀 Key Analytical Features

- Real-time computation of:
  - Total expenditure
  - Net savings
  - Savings rate (%)
  - Highest spending category
- Category-wise expense aggregation
- Spending-to-income ratio analysis
- Rule-based financial health classification
- Dynamic custom category creation for flexible data modeling
- Overspending detection with warning logic



## 📈 Data Visualizations

- **Pie Chart →** Proportional category contribution  
- **Bar Chart →** Absolute category comparison  

These visualizations help in:

- identifying dominant expense areas
- understanding distribution trends
- enabling faster decision making


## 🧠 Insight Generation Logic

The dashboard converts raw numbers into human-readable insights such as:

- “Food expenses are 24% of total income”
- “Savings rate is healthy at 22%”
- “Rent is the highest spending category”

This demonstrates **analytical thinking and business interpretation of data**.
